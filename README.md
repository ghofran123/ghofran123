## ✨ About Me

I'm a Business Intelligence Engineer, i turn raw, messy data into clear stories and reliable systems. My background blends data analysis and data engineering, allowing me to move comfortably from understanding business questions to building the pipelines that answer them.

What defines my work is precision and intention: I care as much about why data exists as how it flows. Whether I’m cleaning datasets, designing dashboards, or structuring models, my goal is always the same — create data solutions that are useful, scalable, and easy to trust.

I use my GitHub as a living lab: a place where I explore datasets, test ideas, document my thinking, and continuously sharpen my skills through real projects rather than theory alone.

Curious by nature and driven by impact, I believe good data work isn’t about complexity — it’s about clarity, discipline, and asking the right questions.
